## Introduction

Recently, I embarked on an journey to rewrite my home page using **Compose Multiplatform** . Coming from an Android development background, this experience allowed me to leverage a familiar technology while exploring its potential on a different platform. This article delves into the pros and cons I encountered during this process and my overall thoughts on using Compose Multiplatform for web development.


## The Pros: Familiar Ground with New Opportunities
- **Leverage Familiarity with Compose:**  As an Android developer, I’m well-acquainted with Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI toolkit for building native Android apps. Using Compose Multiplatform felt like an extension of my existing skills, **significantly reducing the learning curve.**  I didn’t need to adapt to a JavaScript framework like React or Vue; instead, I could focus on Kotlin and Compose’s declarative approach.
- **Basic Features Work Well** : Although Compose Multiplatform for web is still in its early stages, I found that the basics are functional and reliable. **For a simple personal project like my home page, the framework provided the tools I needed to create a clean and responsive UI.**  This made it a compelling choice for smaller projects where you want quick results with minimal complexity.
- **Simplified Workflow for Kotlin Developers:**  Compose Multiplatform provides an opportunity for **Kotlin developers to work on web projects without switching paradigms** . This unified approach made development feel seamless and efficient.


## The Cons: Challenges Along the Way
- **Third-Party Libraries May Fall Short:**  One of the significant drawbacks I faced was compatibility issues with third-party libraries. Since Compose Multiplatform for web is relatively new, many libraries either don’t support it fully or require workarounds. **This can slow down development**  and force you to **write custom solutions for common problems.**
- **Older Browser Compatibility:**  Another significant issue I encountered was the lack of support for older browsers. For example, I had to update my macOS to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Safari. Without this update, certain features simply wouldn’t work as intended. This limitation could be a dealbreaker for projects targeting a broad audience with varying browser versions. **It’s important to test extensively**  and consider fallback options for unsupported environments.
- **Behavioral Differences with Mouse Input:**  Coming from Android development, adapting to the nuances of web-specific behaviors was an eye-opener. For instance, dealing with pointer (mouse) interactions required a shift in perspective compared to touch-based interfaces. These differences demanded extra testing and fine-tuning to ensure a consistent user experience.


## When to Consider Compose Multiplatform for Web

Based on my experience, Compose Multiplatform for web can be an excellent choice under certain conditions:
- **Simple or Small Projects:**  If your project doesn’t rely heavily on third-party libraries or complex web features, Compose Multiplatform provides a straightforward solution.
- **Familiarity with Kotlin:**  If you’re comfortable with Kotlin and Compose, transitioning to web development with this framework is relatively easy.
- **Learning and Experimentation:**  It’s a great way to explore the capabilities of Compose Multiplatform and contribute to its growth.


## Final Thoughts

Rewriting my home page using Compose Multiplatform for web was a rewarding experience. While there were challenges, particularly with library compatibility, build configurations, and browser support, the benefits of using a familiar toolset outweighed the drawbacks. As an Android developer, the ability to work on web projects without diving into a new ecosystem was liberating.

Compose Multiplatform**is still evolving** , but its potential is undeniable. For developers like me who enjoy working with Kotlin and Compose, it offers an exciting glimpse into a unified future for app development. If you’re curious about this technology and willing to navigate its quirks, it’s worth giving it a try!
