# Introduction

In the world of mobile development, **speed** is key, but sometimes **memory leaks** slow us down. In this quick article, we’ll dive into **spotting** and **fixing** these leaks with a tool called **Leak Canary**. It’s like having a detective for your app’s memory. With Leak Canary on our side, we’ll **uncover those hidden memory issues** and fix them quickly. So, buckle up, let&#x27;s make those apps running **smooth as butter**!

# **What is Memory Leak?** 

A memory leak occurs when a program fails to **release memory** **that is no longer needed**, causing unused memory to accumulate over time. This can lead to **performance issues**, **crashes**, and **inefficient** use of system resources, impacting the stability and responsiveness of the application.

# Adding Leak Canary to the project

**LeakCanary**, developed by **Square**, **automatically detects leaks** of various objects, including destroyed **Activity** instances, **Fragment** instances, **View** instances, **ViewModel** instances, and destroyed **Service** instances. Simply **add the debug implementation to your dependencies file** to utilize its functionality. For example:

```groovy
debugImplementation "com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:3.0-alpha-1"
```

When your app runs, ensure **notifications are enabled**  for LeakCanary to indicate any memory leaks. If a leak is detected, it will be displayed in the following format:

Clicking the notification reveals a detailed view of leaks that are being detected and its locations, here is a example app that i made saving the `context`  to a static variable, this could cause crashes and leaks:

# Conclusion
Integrating **LeakCanary**  into your project is **crucial**  for maintaining app stability and performance. It **automatically detects memory leaks** , including those in critical components like Activities, Fragments, etc. Timely detection prevents memory buildup, crashes, and slowness. With detailed leak reports, **identifying and fixing issues**  becomes efficient, ensuring a smooth user experience.
